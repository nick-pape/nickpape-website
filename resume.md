## 📌 Summary

{: .summary }
I'm a seasoned software engineer with over a decade of experience shipping scalable tools and developer infrastructure at Microsoft, Amazon, and early-stage startups. I’ve owned projects ranging from monorepo build systems and cross-platform UI architectures to real-time scheduling platforms for over a million users. I care deeply about reliability, clarity, and impact—whether it's through open-source contributions, mentorship, or hands-on execution.

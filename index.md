## 🧠 About

> _Senior Software Engineer, Roboticist, AI Practitioner, Relentless Optimizer._

I'm a senior engineer at Microsoft and a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence. Professionally, I’ve led front-end and developer tooling efforts for large-scale platforms at Microsoft, Amazon, and early-stage startups. My focus has often been on making complex systems usable—whether that's AI infrastructure, internal dev tools, or customer-facing platforms.

Outside of work, I’m building up deep hands-on experience in AI through my Master’s program and side projects—especially around reinforcement learning, multimodal models, and MCP-based developer workflows. My recent focus is on **robotics, AI system integration, and the messy intersection of hardware and intelligence**.

This site is where I document the systems I build: robots, training pipelines, control infrastructure, and the occasional teardown or build log. It’s technical, iterative, sometimes chaotic—and always hands-on.

## 🔧 Current Projects

- **🦾 Modular Cobot Platform**  
  A 3D-printed, quasi-direct-drive collaborative robot arm using TMC5160 SPI drivers, home-built cycloidal gears, and custom PCBs.  
  _Goal: Payload-class modular arms and mobile bases with swappable connectors, smart drivers, and homegrown control logic._

- **⚙️ MLOps & Training Infrastructure**  
  Local and cloud job orchestration using W&B agents, AWS spot instances, Terraform IaC, Docker image optimization, and artifact management.  
  _Goal: Reproducible, efficient RL and multimodal training across desktop and cloud GPUs._

- **🧩 MCP Server Workflows & Toolchains**  
  Custom-built Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in TypeScript for orchestrating tools with GitHub Copilot.  
  _Goal: Chain structured tool responses, extend dev workflows, and experiment with intelligent agent interfaces._
